RACExample
==========
This will be a buffet of self contained [ReactiveCocoa](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveCocoa) examples, serving to show various different constructs and patterns and how they can be used. The examples will be in small, easy to digest sizes. The project uses Cocoapods, but includes the pod files in the repo to make it easy for anyone to get the project and run it without any hassle.
Branches
==========
There are currently two branches, one that utilizes the current stable release of ReactiveCocoa, which is currently 1.9.5, and a second branch that utilizes the newest unrealeased 2.0 branch of ReactiveCocoa. The 2.0 branch also does not utilize Cocoapods, as there is not podspec for the 2.0 branch. Once ReactiveCocoa 2.0 is released, the 2.0 branch of this project will be merged into master since the 1.x branches will no longer be supported.
